## Introduction
`IEnumerable` is an interface in the System.Collections namespace that defines a single method, `GetEnumerator`, which returns an `IEnumerator`. This interface is the base interface for all non-generic collections that can be enumerated.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and open it in your preferred C# development environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IEnumerableDemo.git
cd IEnumerableDemo
```

## Examples
The project includes several examples demonstrating different aspects of `IEnumerable`:
- Basic iteration using `foreach` and `enumerator`
- Custom collections implementing `IEnumerable`
- Deferred execution with `yield return` - TBD
- LINQ queries on `IEnumerable` collections - TBD
